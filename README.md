# Red-blood-cells-RBC-counts-from-blood-vessel-capillary
Here we counts the number of RBCs presents in a single blood vessel capillary. This is based on two-photon imaging modality. A red dye (Texas-red) 70 kD is used to level the vessel wall. 
This is just simple RBC count based on the black and white line. Here we count the number of white line, which is n+1 of black lines in ideal condition or very clear short duration. But for long time if you missed few RBC may not make much diffrence .
