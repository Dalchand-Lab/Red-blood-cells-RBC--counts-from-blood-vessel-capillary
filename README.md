# Red-blood-cells-RBC-counts-from-blood-vessel-capillary
Here counting the number of RBCs traveling in a single blood vessel capillary. This is based on two-photon imaging modality. A red dye (Texas-red) 70 kD is used to labal the vessel wall. 
In this example RBC count is based on the black and white line. It counts the number of white line, which is n+1 of black lines in ideal condition or very clear/short duration. But for long time say 20 or 30 min if missed few RBC may not make much diffrence.
In this code we used .tiff images. 
Then croped the segment of lines visible in it.
